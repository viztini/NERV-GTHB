# NervGit - NERV-inspired GitHub Theme

A Firefox extension that applies a NERV-inspired color scheme to GitHub, making it look cool and thematic.

## Features

*   **NERV Color Scheme:** Transforms GitHub's default colors to a striking red, grey, and white palette, reminiscent of the NERV organization from Neon Genesis Evangelion.
*   **Improved Readability:** Designed with readability in mind, ensuring a pleasant browsing experience.
*   **Thematic Aesthetics:** Gives your GitHub interface a unique and cool Evangelion-themed look.

## Installation

To install NervGit as a temporary add-on in Firefox:

1.  Open Firefox and type `about:debugging` in the address bar, then press Enter.
2.  In the sidebar, click on "This Firefox".
3.  Click the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button.
4.  Navigate to the `NervGit` directory (where this `README.md` file is located).
5.  Select the `manifest.json` file within the `NervGit` directory.

The extension will now be loaded. Visit any GitHub page, and you should see the new NERV-inspired theme applied.

**Note:** Temporary add-ons are removed when Firefox is closed. To keep the extension permanently, you would need to sign it and install it as a regular add-on, or use a tool like `web-ext run` for development.

## Customization

You can easily customize the theme to your liking:

1.  Open the `NervGit/nerv-theme.css` file in a text editor.
2.  Modify the CSS rules to change colors, fonts, or other visual aspects.
3.  After saving your changes, go back to `about:debugging` in Firefox, find the "NervGit" extension, and click the "Reload" button.
4.  Refresh any GitHub pages to see your updated theme.
